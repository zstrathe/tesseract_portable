v# tesseract_portable
Just saving a portable executable of Tesseract (v4.1.1) for Windows. It's outdated so probably not worth using. I'm also including some example code for usage. My motivation with the portable version of tesseract was to package it neatly (alongside a script that utilizes pytesseract) into a single .exe file with pyinstaller
