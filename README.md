# tesseract_portable
Just saving a portable version of Tesseract (v4.1.1). It's outdated so probably not worth using. I'm also including some example code for usage. My motiation with the portable version of tesseract was to package it neatly (alongside a script that utilizes pytesseract) into a .exe with pyinstaller
