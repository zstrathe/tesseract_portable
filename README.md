Just saving a portable executable of Tesseract (v4.1.1) for Windows that I compiled for a previous project. It's outdated so probably not worth using. I'm also including some example code for usage, which should still work if you can get an updated portable version of Tesseract. My motivation with the portable version of tesseract was to package it neatly, alongside a script that utilizes pytesseract for OCR, into a single .exe file with pyinstaller. 

The benefit of this is that an OCR script in Python can be distributed to users without needing any other dependencies to be installed.

**I still need to include instructions on how PyInstaller needs to be setup**
